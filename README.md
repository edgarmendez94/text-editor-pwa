# text-editor-pwa

## Description
Text editor made as a PWA! able to use online and offline as well as in the browser or on desktop by installing it. Essentially it's a little canvas for you to put down any code or text you feel like typing at the moment. My Heroku deploy for this can be found here: https://my-first-pwa-text-edit.herokuapp.com/

## Installation 
Feel free to git clone the project, make sure of course to "npm install" in the terminal and then after that do a "npm start" and the server will start & webpack will be created as well!

You can also click the install button on the main page of the application and it will install like a chrome app
